To-Do List Application
A simple to-do list app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete to-do tasks. All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist across page reloads.

Features
Add new tasks to the to-do list.
Mark tasks as completed or not completed.
Delete tasks from the list.
Persistent storage using localStorage â€” tasks will remain even after page refresh.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the to-do list and input fields.
CSS: For styling the to-do list (note: the actual CSS is not provided in the code, so you'll need to create your own styles).
JavaScript: For functionality, including adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.
localStorage: To store tasks and keep them persistent across page refreshes.
