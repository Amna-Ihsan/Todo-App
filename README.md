<h1>To-Do List Application</h1>
A simple to-do list app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, mark as completed, and delete to-do tasks. All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist across page reloads.

<h1>Features</h1>
<li>Add new tasks to the to-do list.</li>
<li>Mark tasks as completed or not completed.</li>
<li>Delete tasks from the list.</li>
<li>Persistent storage using localStorage â€” tasks will remain even after page refresh.</li>



<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<li><b>HTML: </b>For the structure of the to-do list and input fields.</li>
<li><b>CSS:</b>  For styling the to-do list (note: the actual CSS is not provided in the code, so you'll need to create your own styles).
</li>
<li><b>JavaScript:</b>  For functionality, including adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.</li>
<li><b>localStorage: </b>To store tasks and keep them persistent across page refreshes.</li>
